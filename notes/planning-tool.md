# Distributed Collective Action Platform

Goal is to have a tool that allows decentralized movements take collective action.

## Needs

### Movement Ideation

People start with a complaint/want/desire. They also want an outlet for this. Even better if it results in progress towards a solution.

### Movement Formation

During the movement formation stage, people are realizing there is a problem as a group and looking for information about it.

* Organically form movements based upon some sort of early input?
* Users explicitly create movements.
* Tagging/clustering?

### Movement Research/Propose

* Sorted by user interest. Lower interest proposals get lost eventually?

### Movement Planning/Action

* Need a way to make decisions that works for most cases.
* FB event-like with distributed decision-making system?

### Action Record/Review

* There's usually a next step...

## Notes

* Make sure there are calls-to-action asking the user to invite additional people or some channel for this to become viral.
  * Make it possible to achieve "badges"/"kudos" from other users.
  * Make it easy to cross-post to other social media platforms.
